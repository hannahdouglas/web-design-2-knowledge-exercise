- The final page should respond smoothly to the browser window expanding/collapsing from mobile to widescreen desktop.

## Tips

- Text to include on the page can be found in content.txt.
- Inspect content in Figma to ensure you are using the correct properties (Google font, colors, sizes, weights, line heights, alignment, etc.).
- Remember to include accessibility attributes where necessary in html.
- To layout content use Flexbox and CSS Grid appropriately for different sections of content, as opposed to floats and positioning. This includes elements that overlap one another.
- Include the Google font in either the html or css.
- Naming conventions are important so double check that all files, folders and paths are correct.
- Be sure to reuse classes and css whenever you can. **Keep your code lean and clean**.
- Commit work as you go.
